# Preparing the device for modem trace

A device can optionally be programmed with modem trace prerequisites, making it easy to get started.

1. Connect the device to your computer's USB port.
2. Click **Select Device** on the left-side panel.</br>
   You can view the name and serial number of Nordic Semiconductor devices connected to your computer.
3. Select the device you want to use.</br>
    The options in the left-side panel are updated. See [Overview and user interface](./overview.md).

    You can also view information on the device's connection settings and status in the Cellular Monitor **LOG** view.

4. If your application does not support Cellular Monitor minimum requirements, **Program** the prerequisites as follows.</br>
   Select and program precompiled sample applications and modem firmware to your device. The samples enable the trace and AT Host prerequisites for Cellular Monitor. Modem firmware supporting trace is available with all samples, and you can choose to program the modem or application firmware, or both. The modem firmware needs only to be programmed once.
