Stuff in this folder really should be placed in pc-nrfconnect-shared but we
currently are not able to do that quickly, e.g. because we first would need
a new launcher release.

This folder has to goals:

- Keep the rest of the codebase cleaner, by having less “This should be
  changed” things spread out over it.
- Make it more obvious, which parts we are still missing in shared.
